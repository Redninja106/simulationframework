SimulationFramework is a cross-platform library for creative coding, game development, and graphical apps built on .NET 6. Designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind, it cuts down on development time for easy rapid prototyping.

### SimulationFramework is:

- **Simple**: SimulationFramework is designed to be developer-friendly. It is well documented and provides flexible, intuitive, and easy-to-use APIs. 

- **Portable**: All platform dependent components are abstracted into interfaces, meaning SimulationFramework can be made to run anywhere .NET can.

- **Documented**: [The wiki](https://github.com/Redninja106/simulationframework/wiki) contains everything you need to know about SimulationFramework, it's features, and how to use them.


### Features:

- **2D Drawing**: A powerful 2D drawing API, backed by [SkiaSharp](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp).

- **Input**: A simple input API that doesn't get in the way.

- **Built-in [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) Support**: Dear ImGui is completely built-in with zero setup.

- **Many more planned**: See [Planned Features](https://github.com/Redninja106/simulationframework#planned-features).

> Note: Right now SimulationFramework is still in the very early stages of development and is changing with every new version.


## Getting Started

> SimulationFramework requires .NET 6 and Visual Studio 2022.

Create a new Console App using .NET 6. Add the [SimulationFramework Nuget Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SimulationFramework/) (and it's desktop environment) using Visual Studio or the .NET CLI via the following commands:

```
dotnet add package SimulationFramework
dotnet add package SimulationFramework.Desktop
```

Next, create a class which inherits from `Simulation`. The abstract methods `OnInitialize` and `OnRender` allow you to add functionality to your simulation

```cs
// MySimulation.cs
using SimulationFramework;
using SimulationFramework.Drawing.Canvas;

class MySimulation : Simulation
{
    // the OnInitialize method is when the simulation is started
    public override void OnInitalize(AppConfig config)
    {
        
    }

    // the OnRender method is called each frame
    public override void OnRender(ICanvas canvas)
    {
        
    }
}
```

To start the simulation, call `Simulation.RunWindowed()`:

```cs
// Program.cs
using SimulationFramework.Desktop;

class Program 
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        MySimulation sim = new MySimulation();
        Simulation.RunDesktop();
    }
}
```

Running the program will result in a blank window:

</div>

Next, to start drawing. The `ICanvas` provided in `OnRender()` contains a variety methods for drawing.

```cs
// MySimulation.cs
using SimulationFramework.Canvas;
using System.Numerics;

// the OnRender method is called each frame
public override void OnRender(ICanvas canvas)
{
    // don't forget to clear the screen each frame!
    canvas.Clear(Color.CornflowerBlue); 
    
    // draw a 50 pixel wide red square centered at the mouse position
    canvas.Fill(Color.Red);
    canvas.DrawRect(Mouse.Position, new Vector2(50, 50), Alignment.Center); 
}
```

The above example produces the following output:

## Planned Features
- **Dependency Free**: SimulationFramework won't depend on any other nuget packages or have any native dependencies (except imgui, which will be optional).
- **3D Drawing**: A performant and cross-platform 3D graphics API complete with a custom C#-inspired shader language. (see the '3d' branch)
- **WebAssembly and Mobile Support**: Any simulations you write will run on a web browser or mobile phone, no code changes needed.
